## Total Error: Using ML to Measure Total Exposure Online

The consequences of measurement error are well studied. One unusual case that is less studied is when the measure of interest is at a different level than at which a measurement is made. For instance, in browsing data, the measurement is taken at the domain level but the measure of interest is at the user level, e.g., total time spent on pornographic websites. Small biases in measurement at the domain level can dramatically affect the validity of the user-level measures. We illustrate the problem through a small [simulation](sim_total_error.md) and formalize and summarize the issue in a small [note](total_error.pdf).
